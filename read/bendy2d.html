                        <h2>Abstract</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>This thesis covers the development process of implementation, and evaluation of a soft-body
                            physics engine for convex polygon objects. The main feature is implementation of a
                            dynamic polygon collider that represents a polygons shape correctly, while still being able
                            to collide with other objects in the simulation. Objects are able to deform both temporarily
                            and permanently using springs with distance constraints. Pressure simulation is also
                            implemented to simulate inflated polygons. The physics bodies does not feature friction
                            between objects, only friction against a static boundary of the simulation. The engine is
                            then evaluated in order to determine if it can run in real-time which is one of the goals.
                            When it comes to the simulation, Verlet-integration will be used for updating the positions
                            of particles, and every polygon will be built using these particles, and combined
                            using certain constraints to make the particles act as one combined object. The main problem
                            that will be solved is the interpenetration solver, which ensures that polygons do not
                            overlap, and two formulas will be combined to solve this problem. The collision detection
                            method uses line intersections to determine if objects are overlapping, this method ended
                            up being quite expensive for polygons with a lot of vertices. One optimization technique
                            is implemented which is axis-aligned bounding boxes around objects which improved
                            performance significantly, which also makes the engine more viable for real-time
                            simulations. The physics engine in this report is deterministic using a fixed time-step,
                            dynamic time-step is not tested. The engine also only supports discrete collision
                            detection.</p>
